class="d-flex"></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">Working on big data can be a hard task, especially on extremely large scale data which requires massive resources and time. This might cause long development cycles and production issues. In many cases, applications can be accelerated dramatically if some approximation is allowed. The idea is to find a sample of the data, that enables fast processing on one hand, but achieves good result accuracy on the other hand. Some of these sampling techniques are used &#x27;behind the scenes&#x27; in popular big data processing frameworks such as Hadoop MapReduce and Spark. In this talk, I will present sampling techniques that enable big data applications to run faster but still obtain accurate results. </div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b0d9c084b330d00147e3384.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Dolev Pomeranz</div><div></div></div><h4>Mapping stores with Augmented Reality and Deep Learning</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">Annotated maps of retail stores are a valuable data.

In the last couple of years our team built a huge production app in react native. In this talk I’ll go over some of our lessons learned in regards of react native performance and how to improve your app’s performance subsequently.

Our first task in Kaduregel Shefel, an alternative art project documenting cultural diversity through football, was to produce our first ever exhibition at an underground gallery in Tel Aviv. The exhibition was a success, with raving reviews from both visitors and media. This was an inspiration for us to continue and expand the project. As the developers that we are, we decided to be agile in order to scale. Using scrum, we were able to scale to video content, producing events abroad, managing communities and meet-ups, collaborating with artists and creating unique products. In this talk we will explain how we leveraged agile on underground art.

Project Reactor is an implementation of the Reactive Streams standard. It&#x27;s become the core of Spring 5 (and consequently Spring Boot 2), and the ecosystem around it grows ever larger. It&#x27;s a powerful and very expressive paradigm for implementing non-blocking behavior, but involves a non-trivial learning curve.

The session will introduce the core principles of reactive streams. We&#x27;ll go into the details of how to implement and test for realistic use-cases applying the reactive programming paradigm.

Open Knesset was a wild ride, including 4,243 commits from 73 contributor, meeting with Rivlin, the Knesset Chairman, a consulting contract and a bribe offer. Eventually we ran out of energy and The site is down since May 2018.

Riding Open Knesset, I learned a lot about the Israeli Democracy, community development and gov.il software and in this talk I&#x27;ll present the mistakes we made and the lessons learnt.

The straight-forward approach for E2E testing no longer suffices and for integration tests it doesn’t even exist. A better way to test in this kind of an environment would be to work with a test kit of the micro-service you are interacting with.
You will learn how to create a test-kit that covers your micro-service. Testing this way will grant you a much higher level of confidence, and will portray a more accurate picture of your assumptions vs. reality. Overall it will make any integration between micro-services easier, thus benefit your colleagues and make your company progress faster.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5ae1656665b29100146c597e.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Lidor Gerstel</div><div></div></div><h4>Rundeck -Visualize Your Release Operation Pipelines</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">Deployment to Production can be scary , in this session I will present an open source solution and a study case on a previous project of mine with Rundeck Orchestrator, which provide a pipeline visualisation of the whole deploy processes. the issues that came up a long the way , the deploy processes itself and report on each deploy.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b101355892ac30014816930.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Yshay Yaacobi</div><div></div></div><h4>Feature-flag driven development with Tweek</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Open Source in Israel (10 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"><div class="font-size-sm mr-3 text-pink">[<!-- -->open source<!-- -->]</div><div class="font-size-sm mr-3 text-red">[<!-- -->Product<!-- -->]</div></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">Feature flags have been trending in the last few years, and for good reason.

By using feature flags correctly, we can leverage techniques such as A/B testing, canary releases, feature gating, kill switches, and more to accomplish these goals.

Feature management solutions have been developed and used at scale by leading tech companies, but unfortunately almost none of them are publicly available.

I will present a service mesh solution, Istio, and how it helped my company to overcome the challenges the new world of micro services presents and deploy our solution in as a secured and properly managed solution.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b0d0c874b330d00147e3367.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Yaron Idan</div><div></div></div><h4>Boosting observability with Fluentd</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">Imagine a world where shipping logs is as easy as writing them to stdout.

We&#x27;ll cover the various common representations of time, acknowledge their caveats and deficiencies, and hopefully learn a few new tools and practices along the way.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b0112b2ea92090014a196c8.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Demi Ben-Ari</div><div></div></div><h4>Hacking for Fun &amp; Profit: The Kubernetes Way</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"><div class="font-size-sm mr-3 text-green">[<!-- -->Infrastructure<!-- -->]</div></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">To defend against attacks, think like a hacker.

With such widespread success, the time is ripe to take a fresh look at dependency injection if we are to understand it better. After all, DI is instrumental in building large systems that are loosely coupled, and it cleanly separates your tests from implementation... or does it?</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b0e984f2743a60014eeb3f6.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Aviram Bar-Haim &amp;&amp; Guy Nadav</div><div></div></div><h4>Periodic Training &amp; Deployment of a Deep-Learning based System at Scale</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">More and more companies are using deep-learning based models. However, periodically updating products with such models is challenging due to large datasets and long training procedures.

Face2Gene, FDNA&#x27;s community-driven platform, is used to aid in the identification of rare diseases. With the constantly growing database, periodic system updates are essential. To enable that, we developed a unified system of data management and a scalable infrastructure to prepare the data and parallelly train and evaluate dozens of models at scale. The result is a production ready system.

In this talk we will describe our system in detail, discuss the design challenges, and share best practices learned.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b103f77892ac30014816950.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Asaf Levy</div><div></div></div><h4>OpenTracing: a new, open distributed tracing standard for applications and OSS packages</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Lightning Talk (5 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"><div class="font-size-sm mr-3 text-green">[<!-- -->Infrastructure<!-- -->]</div></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">Engineering organizations, which are moving to modern microservice architectures, realize that the majority of operational problems that arise when moving to a distributed architecture are in areas: networking and observability.

This was, and still is, a hell of a ride, and we all came out way smarter than we came in. I hope you do too!

In this session, we&#x27;ll talk about what you need to think about when you want to release a pre-existing piece of code to the the public, what the team can gain from having OSS project, the obstacles you may stumble along the way and how to overcome them.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b0ff8c0892ac30014816920.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Omer Duskin</div><div></div></div><h4>Who is Using Your Product?

Conjur Open Source is a security solution built with developers and DevOps in mind. It can free the developers to do what they do best – develop great software – but without compromising their security.
 
In this session I will introduce Conjur Open Source, walk through how native and easy security can become and how you can get started and contribute – right after this session.

על מנת לסייע בכך, יצרה עמותת OWASP את ה-&quot;OWASP Top 10&quot;: רשימת הפגיעויות השכיחות ביותר בקוד! בהרצאה ננתח מס&#x27; אירועים בולטים מעולם הסייבר שאירעו בשנים האחרונות, ונמפה את מקור הבעיה בכל אחד מהם לפגיעות מסויימת מהרשימה, אותה ניצלו ההאקרים על מנת להשיג את מטרתם.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b0da7f94b330d00147e3388.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Daniel Beskin</div><div></div></div><h4>All (reasonable) Roads Lead to Functional Programming</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">It is not uncommon to hear about how elegant Functional Programming is. Granted, some notions of beauty do have their place in the world of software development, but that alone is not a sufficiently compelling reason to endeavour into the unknown. 

In this talk, I will describe my (somewhat idealized) journey from the world of imperative, Java-style programming down the never-ending path of Functional Programming. We will be motivated by simple and relatable concerns, such as: the wish to have less bugs, to write simpler tests and to have altogether more predictable software. This will almost inevitably lead us to re-discover and embrace Functional techniques and the benefits that follow.

In this talk, we will help you navigate the hype, figure out the terminology, address frequently asked questions and help you decide if running Kafka on Kubernetes is the right approach for your organization, and if it is - what do you need to know in order to make it happen.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5affe733d122e50014f3f44b.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Ilya Mirsky</div><div></div></div><h4>Clean your history</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">Long code reviews might be a tedious and error-prone task.

By applying principles, similar to those of Clean Code, on the way we structure our commits along the development of some feature, we can achieve a concise Git history that tells a story. This unique methodology has many advantages including easier and streamlined code reviews, simpler mental models during coding, a better documented project and more.

Should each service provide its peers with a client library to wrap its REST API? (and how thin or fat should this library be?)

We&#x27;ll try to answer questions like: How to move into CI/CD from semi-CI/CD? Can the CI be evergreen? Is this what we want?!</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b102df8892ac30014816944.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Morri Feldman</div><div></div></div><h4>Dynamic HBase Coprocessors Using Clojure</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">HBase coprocessors move data aggregation from the client to the database Server. Coprocessors provide major performance advantages, but programming coprocessors is challenging because the development cycle for coprocessors is slow, tedious and somewhat dangerous. Our solution is to embed a Clojure interpreter inside an HBase coprocessor and to provide Clojure code for aggregations with each query. Our coprocessor then dynamically compiles the aggregations for each query allowing for rapid development and testing.  Extension of this approach to other JVM languages like JRuby or by using GraalVM should be possible. Code and examples are available on GitHub.</div></a><a class="bg-emph p-3 d-block unstyled-link mb-6" href="/session/5b0e9ac02743a60014eeb3f8.html"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="mb-4">Michael Shalyt</div><div><span class="font-mono font-weight-heavy">Day <!-- -->1<!-- --> <!-- -->|<!-- --> <!-- -->11:10-11:40<!-- --> <!-- -->|<!-- --> <!-- -->Gilman 223</span></div></div><h4>Devs are from Mars, Managers are from Venus: How to convince your CEO better code makes better sales</h4><div class="d-flex mb-4"><div class="mr-2 font-size-sm">Full Featured (30 min.)</div><div class="d-flex"><div class="font-size-sm mr-3 text-orange">[<!-- -->Culture<!-- -->]</div></div></div><div class="text-truncate font-size-sm">We’ve all heard it. The “business guys” want everything done, working perfectly, yesterday. The devs on the other hand say it’s not ready, any of it, ever.

Such extreme stereotypes are rarely accurate, but the inherent business &lt;-&gt; R&amp;D tension is very real.

In this talk we’ll discuss the differences in perspective and language between the different roles in a tech company - and understand how can everyone be right while holding opposite opinions. We’ll then go over several tips on how to communicate the dev point of view in the language of business - while making sure everyone are aligned around the greater good of the company.

This approach enables the performance of calculations with an accuracy that is close enough to fully quantum molecular dynamics  but with running speeds that are more than 100 times faster.

2 How GraphQL makes your network transactions more efficient.
3) How GraphQL enforces a strongly typed schema, making it easier for your developers to bridge the gap between the front and back end.
